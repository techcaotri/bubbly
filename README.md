# Notice
The original project is currently incompatible with Ubuntu 22.04. To address this and improve functionality, the following enhancements have been implemented:
- Replaced the 'xinput' method for key detection, as it struggles with identifying BLE keyboards accurately. An alternative approach has been adopted to retrieve keystrokes.
- Abbreviated various keycodes for improved readability and efficiency (e.g., Shift -> Sft, Control -> Ctrl, Up -> 'â†‘').
- Implemented a new termination method: double-pressing 'Ctrl+Esc' now exits bubbly.
- Added a monitor-switching feature for the keystrokes widget, accessible via 'Shift+Ctrl+Alt+<monitor_index>'.
- Enhanced the label widget for each key to auto-expand, preventing text truncation

## About 

- Bubbly lets you create on-screen chat_bubble like widgets based on the keystrokes you type on the keyboard. It uses xinput to fetch the keys and puts them into an eww widget.

- It has 2 modes :
  - **chat** - Creates onscreen chat like widgets based on the keys you type in the form of sentences.
  - **keystrokes** - Creates onscreen widgets to show keystrokes, something like screenkey, keycaster etc.
