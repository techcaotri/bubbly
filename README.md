# Notice
Since the original project doesn't work with Ubuntu 22.04 at the moment. The following enhancements were made compared to the original versions:
 - Use another method to get the keys instead of using 'xinput' with $device parameter since it's difficult to get the right keyboard device with BLE keyboard
 - Shorten many keycodes: Shift -> Sft, Control -> Ctrl, Up -> 'â†‘', etc.
 - Press 'Ctrl+Esc' twice to terminate bubbly 
 - Use 'Shift+Ctrl+Alt+<monitor_index>' as the shortkey to switch monitor for the keystrokes widget

## About 

- Bubbly lets you create on-screen chat_bubble like widgets based on the keystrokes you type on the keyboard. It uses xinput to fetch the keys and puts them into an eww widget.

- It has 2 modes :
  - **chat** - Creates onscreen chat like widgets based on the keys you type in the form of sentences.
  - **keystrokes** - Creates onscreen widgets to show keystrokes, something like screenkey, keycaster etc.
